â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ app.py                # Main Streamlit application
â”œâ”€â”€ model.py              # XGBoost model implementation
â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt      # Required dependencies
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md             # Project documentation

Installation and Setup
Follow these steps to run the project locally:

1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/FoodNutritionBot.git
cd FoodNutritionBot

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate    # On Mac/Linux
.\venv\Scripts\activate     # On Windows

3. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Add your Gemini API key
Create a .env file in the root folder and add:

GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

5. Run the application
streamlit run app.py

6. Access the chatbot
Open your browser and visit: http://localhost:8501

How It Works
The chatbot accepts text or image inputs from users.
For text-based queries, it retrieves detailed nutritional information.
For image-based queries, it leverages the Gemini API for food recognition and generates relevant nutritional details.
The XGBoost Regressor is used to predict missing nutritional data accurately.

Future Enhancements
ðŸ”¹ Expand the database to include more food varieties
ðŸ”¹ Improve the image recognition model for better accuracy
ðŸ”¹ Add calorie tracking and meal planning features
